# dbx_dab_demo

The 'dbx_dab_demo' project was generated by using the default-python template.

```
pip install pytest
pip install python-dotenv
```

**To deploy a development copy of this project, type:**

```
$ databricks bundle deploy --target dev
```
(Note that "dev" is the default target, so the `--target` parameter
is optional here.)

This deploys everything that's defined for this project.
For example, the default template would deploy a job called
`[dev yourname] dbx_dab_demo_job` to your workspace.
You can find that job by opening your workpace and clicking on **Workflows**.

**Similarly, to deploy a production copy, type:**

```
$ databricks bundle deploy --target prod
```

   Note that the default job from the template has a schedule that runs every day
   (defined in resources/dbx_dab_demo.job.yml). The schedule
   is paused when deploying in development mode (see
   https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/bundles/deployment-modes.html).

**To run a job or pipeline, use the "run" command:**

```
$ databricks bundle run
```
